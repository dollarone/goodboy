ahh where to start!


1 bit display!
64x64 for lowrezjam

basic way of describing sprites (on/off basically)
jump and move, maybe bounce as a ball
load map from string and move on it
then make sprites and upgrade to describing and drawing sprites
then enemies
and/or monsters
still use the cave idea, so anything col=0 you can jump on
maybe no monsters?
or two carts, one with, one without

goal is be able to make small 2d platformer AND 2d zeldalike
and fudge it to also create a pong and space invaders type game
and perhaps pacman and snake/arkanoid
sample screen size
ideally with some console around it
load player pos and sprite, 
init() - what do the buttons do?
	eg. move player forward 1 pix UNLESS blocked by collidables (default)
	also background and foreground collections
	and objects (interactable)
		basiaclly events. step on this and change music (if not already playing)
		or play sound or spawn enemy or whatever
	what's the player sprite? (fixed size)
	animations?
	e.g. weapon is controlled by A, has these sprites and is in action in sprites #2 and #3
	support for bow and arrow/gun as well
	init map
	what's the main menu? graphics and menu options
	is camera following player or per-screen. those are your options.
update()
	auto-move anything?
	ai for enemies, eg.: if player is x squares away, do this.
draw()
	anything static?
	e.g ui and inventory

load brings up a form which loads json just like that, ez, can also just write "cave" for example games


"light" button for brighter colour(s)









once all is done, make a dollarmakermaker, which lets you draw sprites and make music(?) and draw maps and create events and basically make games
